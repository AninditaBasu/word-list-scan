# word-list-scan

A script that scans all DITA files in a directory for occurrences of an entire list of words and phrases. Markup tags (without the angle brackets) are also reckoned as words.

Documentation is at [Anin's Documentation Tools](https://doc-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 
## Limitations

It is assumed that all DITA topic files have the `.dita` extension. If your files use the `.xml` extension, this script will not work in its present form.

## Bugs and enhancements

Use GitHub's issue tracking feature.

## Licensing
